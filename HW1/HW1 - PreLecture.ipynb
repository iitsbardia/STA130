    "#### Understanding the Titanic Dataset Structure\n",

    "Objective: To gain a foundational understanding of the Titanic dataset's structure and how to interpret its dimensions and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rows (Observations): Each of the 891 rows represents an individual passenger aboard the Titanic.\n",
    "- Columns (Variables): The 12 columns represent different characteristics (variables) describing each passenger (e.g., PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Age).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explaining Observations and Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations: Refers to individual entries in the dataset; in this case, individual Titanic passengers.\n",
    "- Variables: Refers to the features or attributes recorded for each observation, such as survival status, class, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrepancies in Data Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-Numeric Variables: df.shape reports all columns, but df.describe() by default only includes numeric variables. This results in fewer columns being analyzed by df.describe().\n",
    "- Missing Values in Numeric Variables: df.shape counts all rows, but df.describe() counts only non-missing entries for each column. This can lead to discrepancies in the \"count\" between these two methods, particularly noticeable in columns with missing data like Age.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussed how to generate and interpret summary statistics for both numeric and categorical data within the dataset, adjusting the approach based on the nature of each variable (e.g., treating Survived as a categorical variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Adjustments:\n",
    "Adjusted Python code to correctly summarize the dataset, accounting for the specific nature of binary and categorical columns like Survived and Pclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "The Titanic dataset was dissected to understand its structure and the characteristics of its variables. Practical steps to summarize the dataset were discussed, and Python code was provided and adjusted to handle specific data types accurately."
